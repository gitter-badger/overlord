  <h2>About Overlord</h2>
  <div class="about">
    <p>Overlord is quite an ambitious project. It's aimed to unify the functionality of chat bots, alert systems and overlay managers used in streaming - particularly on Twitch, but who knows what the future brings.</p>

    <p>Overlord is written in NodeJS and uses Redis as backend - the latter might change though.</p>

    <p>I'm currently looking for streamers who'd test Overlord as releases get rolled out in the future, as well as peeps willing to send feature requests. Anything you'd like to see in a project like this, open the Issues page and send a feature request. Who knows, it'll might be implemented!</p>
